FreeImage can be downloaded here: 
 http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/

WINDOWS
Simply copy "FreeImage.dll" to C:\WINDOWS\system32 OR add directory containing the dll to the system path (via Control Panel->System->Advanced->Environment Variables->Path).

LINUX
(1) Compile: download the freeimage source code and run "make". Alternatively could use the .so and .a files in this directory (should work on some? versions of Linux). Next, if have root privileges simply run "make install" from source freeimage source directory and you're done. Otherwise:
(2) Change permissions, create additional link files. Copy and paste below into shell from this directory:
  chmod 644 libfreeimage.a
  chmod 755 libfreeimage-3.11.0.so
  ln -sf libfreeimage-3.11.0.so ./libfreeimage.so.3
  ln -sf libfreeimage.so.3 ./libfreeimage.so	
(3) Add to runtime search path (same as adding dll to C:\WINDOWS\system32). See 3.5 in http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html.  The below command should be added to ~/.bash_profile. Type "export" in shell to see environment and if LD_LIBRARY_PATH properly set.
   # add freeimage to LD_LIBRARY_PATH so at runtime linker knows where to look
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/common/pdollar/boosting/freeimage:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
